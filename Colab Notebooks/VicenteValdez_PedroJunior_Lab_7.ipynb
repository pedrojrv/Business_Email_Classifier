This has the effect of reducing overfitting and improving model performance.\" Then it is obvious that increasing the dropout will lead to a less overfit model but in this case to a worse performer since it is not memorizing the poem. Therefore a dropout of 0 is better. In a sense, we are overfitting the model to memorize the entire poem. The problem with high dropout is obvious if you see the results of a dropout=0.9."]},{"metadata":{"colab_type":"code","id":"bh9kQZnr7koK","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# 4.1 Training at a Word Level"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"Ss-D8Xz1ZR2z","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"outputId":"f5b6ed0c-2795-4835-ffd6-341be1a72000"},"cell_type":"code","source":["# encode the text as integers\n","tokenizer = Tokenizer()\n","tokenizer.fit_on_texts([s])\n","encoded = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences([s])[0]\n","\n","# determine the vocabulary size\n","vocab_size = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1\n","print('Vocabulary Size: %d' % vocab_size)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Vocabulary Size: 51\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"JghDuG1GZR24","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"outputId":"ac4f1ebc-fa49-4fb8-ab19-b8c756c75c4a"},"cell_type":"code","source":["# create word -> word sequences\n","sequences = list()\n","for i in range(1, len(encoded)):\n","    sequence = encoded[i-1:i+1]\n","    sequences.append(sequence)\n","print('Total Sequences: %d' % len(sequences))"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Total Sequences: 76\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"id":"pMQkMr5OZR28","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":["# split into X and y elements\n","sequences = np.array(sequences)\n","X, y = sequences[:,0],sequences[:,1]\n","\n","# one hot encode outputs\n","y = to_categorical(y, num_classes=vocab_size)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"Ub4Lxy0QZR2_","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"outputId":"a6553873-5387-46c2-8d72-3c71193451ee"},"cell_type":"code","source":["model = Sequential() #This is were LSTM starts\n","model.add(Embedding(vocab_size, 10, input_length=1)) #How many output dimensions you want at the output\n","model.add(LSTM(500)) #number of hidden nodes \n","model.add(Dense(vocab_size, activation='softmax'))\n","print(model.summary())\n","\n","# compile network\n","model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])\n","# fit network\n","model.fit(X, y, epochs=500, verbose=2)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["_________________________________________________________________\n","Layer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   \n","=================================================================\n","embedding_6 (Embedding)      (None, 1, 10)             510       \n","_________________________________________________________________\n","lstm_22 (LSTM)               (None, 500)               1022000   \n","_________________________________________________________________\n","dense_21 (Dense)             (None, 51)                25551     \n","=================================================================\n","Total params: 1,048,061\n","Trainable params: 1,048,061\n","Non-trainable params: 0\n","_________________________________________________________________\n","None\n","Epoch 1/500\n"," -

Optimize the following cells above to get the model to work reasonably well on the above generated sentences. Again, this is a toy problem as language models require a lot of computation... so this toy problem is great for rapid experimentation to explore different aspects of deep learning language models.\n","\n","The model indeed was optimized for better accuracy by increasing the number of epochs and the number of units. Increasing the number of units by itself increased the accuracy of the model but the addition of more epochs boosted the model. The best model of all the models trained in this notebook was the LSTM with 500 units and 500 epochs trained in 10 characters.\n","\n","2. Write a function to split the text corpus file into training and validation and pipe the validation data into the model.fit() function to be able to track validation error per epoch. Lookup Keras documentation to see how this is handled.\n","\n","This was done easily by adding the validation_split parameter to the model.fit() function. In the output of the cell you can visualize the validation loss and the validation accuracy per epoch.\n","\n","3. Write a summary (methods and results) in the below cells of the different things you applied. You must include your intuitions behind what did work and what did not work well\n","\n","In summary, various models were trained:\n","\n","- Trained in 10 characters\n","- Trained per word\n","- Trained per two words\n","- Trained by line\n","\n","In general the 10 character model was found to be better when we fixed the number of epochs. I am sure the line by line model could perform better provided the correct number of memory units and epochs but for the sake of comparison we fixed the number of epochs and units to be able to compared different training methodology easily. The models in general we're found to have trouble when predicting words after inputing a word that is repeated througout the text even when they correctly predict the previous context. The problem was fixed but then new problems arised in other parts of the prediction. \n","\n","4. Do something even more interesting. Try a different source text. Train a word-level model. We'll leave it up to your creativity to explore and write a summary of your methods and results. \n","\n","As previously stated, we succesfully trained at word level, at two word level, and at line-by-line level. \n","\n","\n","# To Do RESULTS:\n","- Try different numbers of memory cells (DONE)\n","We tried different number of cells including 500 and 1000. Training time increased considerable for higher number of unit cells. The model with higher epochs performs overall better but in some parts of the text the lower unit model performed better. Therefore training with higher units does not necessarly mean that the model will perform better in every part of the text. Adding more layers will fix this problem since knowledge from the accurate less epoch model will be preserved. \n","\n","- Try different lengths of training epochs \n","Adding more epochs lead to a better model overall since the model goes over the data various times. This is independent of the training strategy. In almost all situations increasing the number of epochs will result in a better model.\n","\n","- Try different sequence lengths and pre-processing of data\n","As mentioned previously we tried training character by character, word by word, two words per two words, and line by line. \n","\n","- Try regularization techniques such as Dropout.\n","Different levels of dropout where tested. Introducing dropout lead to a worse model in this case. According to MLmastery: \"Dropout is a regularization method where input and recurrent connections to LSTM units are probabilistically excluded from activation and weight updates while training a network. This has the effect of reducing overfitting and improving model performance.\" Then it is obvious that increasing the dropout will lead to a less overfit model but in this case to a worse performer since it is not memorizing the poem. Therefore a dropout of 0 is better. In a sense, we are overfitting the model to memorize the entire poem. The problem with high dropout is obvious if you see the results of a dropout=0.9."]},{"metadata":{"id":"DJnGHV8qZR4a","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]}]}
